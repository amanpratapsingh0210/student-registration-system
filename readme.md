# Student Registration System

## Project Description

This is a simple, client-side Student Registration System developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student records. The application is fully responsive and uses the browser's `localStorage` to persist data, meaning records are not lost when the page is refreshed.

## Features

1. **Add New Students:** A clean form to register new students with their name, ID, email, and contact number.
2. **View Registered Students:** All registered students are displayed in a clear, organized table.
3. **Edit Existing Records:** Easily update the details of any registered student.
4. **Delete Records:** Remove student records that are no longer needed.
5. **Data Persistence:** Student data is automatically saved to the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring no data is lost on page reload.
6. **Input Validation:** The form validates inputs to ensure data integrity (e.g., name contains only characters, email is in the correct format, contact number has at least 10 digits).
7. **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Technologies Used

1. **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content.
2. **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox), and responsiveness (Media Queries).
3. **JavaScript (ES6):** For DOM manipulation, event handling, validation, and interaction with `localStorage`.
